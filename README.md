# SimpleFileEdit
We regularly receive documents from an external system: weekly status reports, monthly overviews, detailed reports. Sometimes, these documents are plain text files, and sometimes they are xml files. We want to upload these documents to our database. However, before we upload them, we want to search and replace certain text phrases in the documents.  Currently, we only want to search for specific text phrases, but we expect that we will want to be able to use a more flexible search in the future; patterns or wildcards or variables â€“ we have not decided yet.
